        <h1>Ode to Browsing the Web</h1>
        <h2>By Marcus Wicker</h2>
        <p>heartbeat. I’ve been told the internet is <br>
            an unholy place — an endless intangible <br>
            
            stumbling ground of false deities <br>
            dogma and loneliness, sad as a pile of shit <br>
            
            in a world without flies. My loneliness exists <br>
            in every afterthought. Yesterday, I watched <br>
            
            a neighbor braid intricate waves of cornrows <br>
            into her son’s tiny head and could have lived <br>
            
            in her focus-wrinkled brow for a living. Today <br>
            I think I practice the religion of  blinking too much.</p>
